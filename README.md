# Face_recognition-Eigenfaces
We implement the Eigenfaces method (which is a combination of PCA for feature extraction and K Neighbors Classifier for face recognition). We use face images from Yale B faces database, in which there are 10 people's faces that have been photographed under 64 different lighting conditions. 

After implementing the method, we evaluate our model's capability of handling these conditions, that differ in training and test set.
